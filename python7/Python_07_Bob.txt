Bob by Shel Silverstein



Bob loves me,

Bob cares,

Bob picks me peaches and pears.

Bob offers me candy and Cokes,

Bob listens and laughs at me jokes.

Bob helps when I get in a fight,

Bob does all my homework at night.

Bob misses me,

Bob cries,

Bob thinks I'm a wonderful guy.

So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,

I'll stand up and tell you that Bob is.

But yesterday night I got quite a scare,

I woke up and Bob just wasn't there.

I called out and reached out for Bob's hand,

In the darkness where Bob usually stands.

Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,

But I found somebody each place that I looked.

I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,

There's no doubt about it-

Bob's gone!
